# Scroll Fix | [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfiniteCraftCommunity/userscripts/master/userscripts/ScrollFix/index.user.js)

Fixes the sidebar scrolling all over the place when searching.

This makes the sidebar scroll to the results when searching, and to the top of the sidebar if the search bar is empty.
