![Icon](https://i.imgur.com/WlkWOkU.png)

## 📜 Description
This **Userscript** allows you to block item creation in [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) using regular expressions (RegEx).  
- **Block item creation** based on a custom RegEx pattern.  
- **Experimental (Beta)**: The settings will be reset after each page reload.  

## 🚀 Features
- **Block specific items** from being created by using RegEx.  
- Customize settings to block:
  - Items that match a RegEx pattern.
  - Not if they are First Discoveries.
  - Not items you don't currently own.

## 📝 Usage
1. **Click the "Create Conditions" button** in the settings menu.  
2. **Enter a RegEx pattern** to block specific items from being crafted.
3. Choose whether to block:
   - **Newly discovered items** (items that are "new" in the game).
   - **Items you don't currently have**.
4. The settings will reset after each page reload, so be sure to update them again if needed.

## ⚠️ Notes
- This script is in **extreme beta**. Settings are **not saved** after reloading the page.
- Use caution when setting the RegEx, as blocking important items could disrupt gameplay.
