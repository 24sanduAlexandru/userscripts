# Kit (reviver) | [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfiniteCraftCommunity/userscripts/master/userscripts/Kit/index.user.js)

Kit can literally make anything, apart from some stuff.
Open the Console (Ctrl + Shift + I) and type
```revive(\`words`)``` in there. Seperate multiple elements by new lines.
To modify tools used, check out the settings at the top of the code.
