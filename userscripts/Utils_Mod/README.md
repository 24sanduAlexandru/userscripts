- saves all elements on screen into one Tab
- Tabs save on reloading/closing Infinite Craft
- Downloading/Uploading Tabs
- spawning entire Alphabets (right click the Add Button)




# Misc
- copy hovered element to clipboard
  - Ctrl + C to copy the text of a hovered Element
  - Ctrl + Shift + V to paste Element(s)
  - Also works on Selections!
  - You can also paste in gigantic lists, for example all countries (just seperate each "Word" with a new line)
